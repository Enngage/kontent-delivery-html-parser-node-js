# Node.js parser for Rich text elements

This library is an optional addon for the [javascript delivery SDK](https://github.com/Kentico/kontent-delivery-sdk-js) that can be used to resolve rich text elements in `node.js` environment. 

This is an alternative to built-in `browserRichTextResolver` that comes native with the SDK and works in browsers.
